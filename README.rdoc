= CPF Faker

Generates Brazilian CPF numbers for use in testing. Great to be used alongside {Faker}[https://github.com/stympy/faker] and won't clutter your namespace. 

Good and simple code with working specs.

== Install

Use rubygems:

  gem install cpf_faker
  
Or add it to your Gemfile if your project uses bundler (ex.: Rails apps)

  group :development do
    # ...
    gem 'cpf_faker'
  end

== Usage

  require 'cpf_faker'

  Faker::CPF.numeric    #=> "32586104447"

  Faker::CPF.pretty     #=> "419.356.777-05"

== Motivation

I got tired of using lame "Ad bait" sites to generate CPFs. And needed to generate several to populate a test database.

So I invested 30 minutes to make this into a simple gem others could use.

== Credits

Syntax based on the {Faker}[https://github.com/stympy/faker] gem. 

Generation of the verification digits shamelessly stolen from the {validates_as_cpf}[https://github.com/sobrinho/validates_as_cpf] Rails Plugin (credit to Gabriel Sobrinho).

{br-cpf}[https://github.com/bbcoimbra/br-cpf] gem used for cross validation in the specs (credit to Bruno Coimbra). 

== Contributing to cpf_faker
 
* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Make sure to add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.
* Please try not to mess with the Rakefile, version, or history. If you want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around it.
